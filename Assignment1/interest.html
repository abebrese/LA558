  My hobbies include travelling and reading. A place I recently visited is Accra. Accra is the capital of Ghana with an estimated urban population of 2.27 million as of 2012. The city covers an area of 86.78 square miles. <h4> History </h4> Founded in the late 1600s by the Ga people, the name "Accra" is derived from the Akan word <i>Nkran</i> meaning "ants", a reference to the numerous anthills seen in the countryside around Accra. By the end of the 17th century, Accra had been home to the Portuguese, Swedish, British, Danish, Dutch and French who all built forts in the town  and used the city as a center for trade. In present day Accra, the original Ga town, as well as the Dutch, Danish and British forts and their communities form the four corners fo the core of the modern city.<br><img src="http://akm-rentacar.com/photos/locations/ghana-accra-downtown.jpg"/>
